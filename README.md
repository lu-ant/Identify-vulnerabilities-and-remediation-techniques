# Identifying Vulnerabilities and Remediation Techniques

## üìå Overview  
This project demonstrates how to identify and remediate security vulnerabilities in a web application hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The lab focuses on detecting and fixing a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability using **Google Cloud Web Security Scanner** and implementing security best practices.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps Performed  

### **1. Launching a Virtual Machine**  
- Created a **static IP address** using `gcloud compute addresses create`.  
- Launched a **VM instance** with `gcloud compute instances create`.  
- Installed **Flask**, a Python web framework, to run the vulnerable web application.  

### **2. Setting Up and Running the Vulnerable Application**  
- Created a **firewall rule** to allow access on port `8080` for vulnerability scanning.  
- Established an **SSH connection** to the VM.  
- Downloaded and extracted the vulnerable web application.  
- Started the Flask application (`python3 app.py`).  

### **3. Testing for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability**  
- Accessed the application via the browser using `<STATIC_IP>:8080`.  
- Injected **malicious JavaScript** into the web form:  
  ```html
  <script>alert('This is an XSS Injection to demonstrate one of OWASP vulnerabilities')</script>
Observed the alert pop-up, confirming an XSS vulnerability.

4. Scanning for Vulnerabilities
Enabled Google Web Security Scanner API.
Configured a new security scan targeting the application.
Detected the XSS vulnerability via automated scanning.

5. Remediating the XSS Vulnerability
Edited the app.py file to sanitize user input by escaping HTML characters:
python

output_string = "".join([html_escape_table.get(c, c) for c in input_string])
Restarted the web application with the security fix.

6. Re-scanning to Verify Fixes
Re-ran the Web Security Scanner to check for vulnerabilities.
Verified that the XSS vulnerability was successfully remediated.

üîç Key Findings & Fixes
Vulnerability	Description	Remediation
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)	Web app accepts unescaped user input.	Implement input validation & HTML escaping.

Open Firewall Rule	Allowed access from all IPs.	Restrict firewall rules to trusted IPs.

üöÄ Lessons Learned
‚úÖ Proactive vulnerability scanning helps identify security risks before exploitation.
‚úÖ Web applications must sanitize user input to prevent XSS and other injection attacks.
‚úÖ Cloud security tools like Web Security Scanner automate the detection of web vulnerabilities.
‚úÖ Firewall rules should be restrictive to limit exposure.
